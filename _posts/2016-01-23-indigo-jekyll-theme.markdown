Full implementation details at my [Github](http://sergiokopplin.github.io/indigo/)

Approach Taken:

- Extract, transform & load (ETL) data onto a VM Instance on Google Cloud
- Perform wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Create Train/Validation datasets
- Create machine learning models using train data
	- Regression  - Tree Based Models
	- Classification – Neural Network 
- Validate models using the mean haversine distance and thereafter predict on test data set
